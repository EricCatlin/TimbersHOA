CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION
FOR
THE TIMBERS, A CONDOMINIUM
ARTICLE 1 CONSTRUCTION AND VALIDITY OF DECLARATION
Section 1.1 Purpose. The Declarant has recorded this Declaration to create an airspace condominium community upon the real estate described in Schedule A. By recording this
Declaration and the Map, Declarant is submitting the real property to CIC Act to enhance the value
of the Community, establish a system for governance of the Community, and protect the interests
of Persons having any right, title or interest to real estate in the Community pursuant to the CIC
Act. This Declaration shall be effective as of the date that it is recorded.
Section 1.2 Construction. The creation and operation of the Community are governed
by this Declaration, the Map, the Washington Miscellaneous and Mutual Corporations Act, and the
CIC Act. In the event a provision of the Declaration is inconsistent with a provision of the CIC Act,
the provisions of the CIC Act will prevail. In the event of a conflict between a provision of this
Declaration and the Bylaws, the Declaration will prevail except to the extent the Declaration is
inconsistent with the CIC Act. An insignificant failure of the Declaration or the Map, or any
amendment thereto, to comply with the CIC Act will not, however, invalidate the creation of the
Community, nor will it make unmarketable or otherwise affect the title to a Unit and its Common
Ownership Interest.
Section 1.3 Covenant Running with Land. This Declaration shall operate as servitude
and shall bind the Declarant, the Association, all Owners and any other Persons having any right,
title or interest in the real estate subject to this Declaration, or any portion thereof, together with
their grantees, successors, heirs, executors, administrators, devisees or assigns, and shall inure to
the benefit of every portion of the Condominium property and any interest therein, and each Owner,
and his/her heirs, successors and assigns. Acceptance of any portion of the Condominium
property shall be deemed acceptance of the terms and provisions of this Declaration.
Section 1.4 Severability. The provisions of this Declaration shall be independent and
severable, and the unenforceability of any one provision shall not affect the enforceability of any
other provision if the remaining provision or provisions comply with the CIC Act.
Section 1.5 Percentage of Owners or Mortgagees. For purposes of determining the
percentage of Owners, Mortgagees or voting power necessary to approve a proposed decision or
course of action where an Owner owns, or a Mortgagee holds Mortgages on, more than one Unit,
an Owner shall be deemed a separate Owner for each Unit so owned and a Mortgagee shall be
deemed a separate Mortgagee for each first Mortgage so held.
Section 1.6 Inflationary Increase in Dollar Limits. Any dollar amounts specified in this
Declaration in connection with any proposed action or decision of the Board or Association shall be
proportionately increased on July 1 of each year by the percentage change in the consumer price
index specified in Section 065(2) of the CIC Act.
ARTICLE 2 DEFINITIONS

deemed to be the Common Elements unless this Declaration has been amended or modified and
states that such amendment or modification changes the Common Elements shown on the Map.
Section 7.2 Use of Common Elements. Except as otherwise stated in this Declaration,
no Owner may alter any Common Element or construct or remove anything in or from any

Section 7.5 Conveyance or Encumbrance of Common Elements. Any conveyance,
encumbrance, judicial sale or other transfer (voluntary or involuntary) by a Unit Owner of its interest
in the Common Elements shall be void unless the Unit to which that interest is allocated is also

Common Elements unless Owners of Units to which at least 80% of the Voting Interests in the
Association are allocated, including 80% of the votes allocated to Units not owned by the
Declarant, agree to that action. All Owners of Units to which any Limited Common Element is
allocated must, however, agree in order to convey that Limited Common Element or subject it to a
security interest. Any agreement to convey Common Elements or subject them to a security
interest must be evidenced by the execution of an agreement, or ratification of an agreement, in the
same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of Unit Owners. The agreement must specify a

Rights of the Declarant, no Common Element may be reallocated as a Limited Common Element,
and no Common Element or Limited Common Element may be incorporated into an existing Unit

Declaration and the Map.
Section 8.3 Reallocation Between Units. An allocation of a Limited Common Element
may not be altered without the consent of the Owners of the Units to which the Limited Common
Element is allocated. Except in regard to the Development Rights of the Declarant, a Limited
Common Element may be reallocated between Units only with the approval of the Board and by an
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -10-
amendment to the Declaration executed by the Owners of the Units to which the Limited Common
Element is allocated. The Board shall approve the request of the Owner or Owners under this
Section 8.3 within 30 days, unless the reallocation does not comply with the CIC Act or the
Declaration. The failure of the Board to act upon a request within such period shall be deemed
approval thereof. The amendment shall be recorded in the names of the parties and of the
Community.
Section 8.4 Right to Use Limited Common Elements. Each Owner of a Unit to which a
Limited Common Element is allocated shall have the exclusive right to use the Limited Common
Element in common with the other Owners, if any, to which that Limited Common Element is
allocated. The right to use the Limited Common Element extends to the Owner’s Authorized
Users, and is governed by the provisions of the CIC Act and the Governing Documents.
ARTICLE 9 EASEMENTS
Section 9.1 Unit Owners. Subject to the Governing Documents and to the
Association’s rights to regulate the use, maintenance, repair, replacement and modification of the

easement in and through the Common Elements for access to its Units; and (ii) a right to use the

downspouts, utility meters, vents and other similar portions of the Owner’s Home; or (ii) any
encroachment caused by the construction, reconstruction or repair of the improvements, or the
natural settlement, shifting, or movement of the improvements or land. Such easements shall exist
so long as the encroachments exist or the Unit Owner has the right to cause them to be replaced,
provided, however, no valid easement shall exist if the encroachment was caused willfully by the
Owner. Such encroachments shall not be construed to affect the marketability of title to any Unit,
nor shall they alter the rights and obligations of the Owners.
Section 9.4 Association Functions Easement. The Association has such easements
throughout the Community as are necessary to perform the duties and obligations of the
Association as are set forth in the Governing Documents. The Declarant hereby grants to the
Association an easement over the Units and all portions thereof and therein for the purpose of
otherwise carrying out all obligations, duties, responsibilities and rights of the Association contained
in this Declaration.
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -11-
Section 9.4.1 Landscape Buffer Easements. The Association was granted access
to the Landscape Buffer Easement on Lots 62 through 75 as dedicated on the

Association finds they are not maintained during their inspection, the Association
has the right granted to them in Section 11.1.2.
Section 9.5 Entry Monument Easement. To the extent located on any Unit or the
Common Elements, the Association has an easement on, under, over and across such Unit or
Common Element for the purpose of installing, modifying, maintaining, repairing and replacing,

right of ingress and egress thereto.

street frontage and a 20 foot sanitary sewer and water easement over a portion of Units 22 and 23.
No structure, planting, or other material that may damage the utilities or interfere with the use of the
easement may be placed within these easement areas. The Owners of the Units subject to utility
easements shall not use or alter their Units in any way that would interfere with the proper
operation of the storm drainage system or other utilities located within such easement. The
Association may adopt Rules regarding use of the portions of the Units subject to these
easements.
Section 9.9 Easement over Tract 999 (Stormwater). Pursuant to Section G(5) of
Attachment E to the Second Amendment of City Development Agreement: (a) the City owns Tract

further described in Schedule E (the “Tract 999 Costs”). The Tract 999 Costs shall be a Common
Expense.
Section 9.10 Private Fence, Retaining Wall and Rockery Easements. Declarant may
construct certain rockeries, walls and fences between certain Units and Common Elements. The
intention of the Declarant is that each fence, when constructed, shall be located wholly within one
Unit or another and not on the property line between Units or Common Elements. Due to
obstructions or topography, however, a fence may not be wholly within a Unit or Common Element
or immediately adjacent to the property line. Therefore, Declarant reserves an easement on each
side of each boundary line, for the Association and each Unit Owner for the installation,
maintenance, repair and replacement of walls and fences installed by the Declarant for as long as
the wall or fence exists. The Owner of such a fence shall have reasonable access over the
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -12-
adjoining Unit or Common Element for the purposes of maintaining any fence or retaining wall
located on or benefitting their Unit subject to the maintenance restriction contained in Section
11.1.1.6. Before performing any such maintenance, repair or improvements, the Owner shall give
all other Owners of the adjacent Units reasonable advance notice (except in an emergency), and
shall only enter the adjoining Unit or Units at reasonable times and shall promptly repair any
damage caused thereby and restore the property to the condition it was in prior to the entry and
shall otherwise indemnify the Association and Owner of the adjacent Unit from any damage caused
by such entry. Neither the location of any fence or wall installed by Declarant, nor any conduct of
the fence owner in maintaining the land between a neighboring fence (or wall) and the property line
shall be construed as modifying the property line. The Owner of a cedar fence shall be responsible
for keeping the fence in good condition and repair. The Owners whose Units have or are
immediately adjacent to a retaining wall or rockery shall share equally in the cost of maintaining,
replacing and improving such retaining wall or rockery such that it shall remain in good working
order.
Section 9.11 Declarant. The Declarant has an easement through the Common
Elements as is reasonably necessary for the purpose of developing and discharging the
Declarant’s obligations or exercising Special Declarant Rights, and as is necessary to conduct
inspections and tests from time to time of all or any parts of the Units or Common Elements, and to
determine whether maintenance, repairs or replacements of any such improvements are indicated.
The Declarant shall restore the affected portion of the property to substantially the condition
immediately prior thereto, and shall indemnify the Association and Owners of any affected Units
from any damage resulting therefrom.
9.11.1 Declarant Easement Regarding Development Bonds. The
Association hereby acknowledges, and all Owners by their acceptance of a deed to any
Unit acknowledge, that the Declarant or its predecessor posted or will be required to post
one or more maintenance bonds with the City, County or other public governmental
authority with jurisdiction over the development of the Community (collectively the
“Development Bonds”) in connection with Declarant’s build out and the maintenance of
certain Common Elements, improvements, landscaping, Street trees, storm water/drainage
facilities, and/or other items and shared facilities within and serving the Community (all
such areas and items, collectively, the “Development Improvements”). Copies of the
Development Bonds are on file with the City. The Association and all Owners further
acknowledge that they are or will be benefitted by use of the Development Improvements
installed under and covered by the Development Bonds and that Declarant will remain
obligated to complete certain maintenance and repair work under the Development Bonds
until the applicable jurisdiction releases the Development Bonds back to Declarant.
Declarant shall be responsible for initially installing and completing all Development
Improvements as required by the governmental authority. Thereafter, the Association shall
keep and maintain, or ensure that any responsible Owners keep and maintain, all
Development Improvements in good condition and repair. Until such time that the City or
other governmental authority releases the last of the Development Bonds back to
Declarant, Declarant hereby reserves for itself an easement over the Units, Common
Elements and remainder of the Property for the purpose of accessing, inspecting,
maintaining, repairing and restoring any Development Improvement covered by a
Development Bond to the extent required by the applicable jurisdiction holding the
Development Bond or as necessary to ensure that such Development Bonds will be
released back to Declarant. The foregoing easement is expressly intended to survive and
to continue until all Development Bonds are released in full. Declarant and its successors
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to exercise the foregoing easement rights in a
manner that minimizes interference with Owners and the Community, to the extent
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -13-
reasonably practicable. If the Association or any Owner causes or permits damage to an
item installed under or covered by a Development Bond or otherwise fails to maintain such
an item when they had an obligation to maintain the same under this Declaration, the Map
or other binding instrument, and Declarant may exercise its easement rights in this
paragraph to maintain, repair or replace any aspect of a Development Improvement
installed under or covered by a Development Bond, then Declarant shall have the right to
perform such maintenance, repair or replacement work and to thereafter seek
reimbursement for all reasonable costs incurred from the Association or the responsible
Owner. The responsible party shall reimburse Declarant for all such reasonable costs
incurred within 30 days after demand, otherwise such costs shall bear interest at the
statutory rate and Declarant shall have the right pursue collection of such amounts through
any legal means available at law or in equity. For so long as any Development Bonds
remain in place, this paragraph may not be amended without the written consent of
Declarant. The Association (or any designated Manager), the ACC and Declarant shall
have a limited right of entry in and upon the exterior of all improvements located on any
Unit for inspection purposes, and taking whatever corrective action may be deemed
necessary or proper, consistent with the provisions of this Declaration. However, nothing
herein shall be construed to impose an obligation upon the Association, the ACC, or
Declarant to maintain or repair any portion of any Unit or any improvement thereon which is
the obligation of the Owner to maintain as provided herein. Nothing in this Article shall in
any manner limit the right of any Owner to the exclusive occupancy and control over the
improvements located upon their Unit, provided each Owner shall permit access to such
Owner’s Unit and improvements by any Person authorized by the Association, the ACC, or
Declarant (including any designated Manager) as is reasonably necessary, in case of any

ARTICLE 10 USE RESTRICTIONS AND CONDUCT RESTRICTIONS
Section 10.1 Use Restrictions. The following use restrictions shall apply to all Units.
10.1.1 Allowed Use. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, no
Unit shall be used except for residential purposes (and for social, recreational, or other
reasonable activities normally incidental to such use); provided, however, upon the written
request by an Owner, the Board may allow an Owner to conduct an "in-home business",
provided all business activities are carried on within the Home and that there are not an
unreasonable number of employees, clients, customers, tradesmen, student, suppliers, or
others that come to the Home in connection with such business, but in no event in any
number that would unduly burden the Community, its parking or create a material amount
of additional traffic through the Community, as such standards are determined by the
Board in its sole and absolute discretion. The determination of whether or not a use is
incidental to residential uses shall be made by the Board and shall be binding on all
Owners. The Units may also be used for the purpose of operating and managing the
Community. The Board may, by Rule, specify the limits of residential use in general and
also in particular cases. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Declarant may use any of the
Units owned by Declarant as allowed by the CIC Act or this Declaration. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent required under the CIC Act, operation of an “adult family home”
on a Unit shall not be prohibited.
10.1.2 Prohibited Uses. The Property is being developed as a residential
condominium development. The Units may not be used for Timesharing, as defined in
Chapter 64.36 RCW. The Units may not be used for hotel or transient purposes, which
shall be defined as: (i) rental for a period of less than one year; (ii) rental under which
occupants are provided customary hotel services such as room service for food and
beverages, maid service, the furnishing of laundry and linen, busboy service, and similar
services; or (iii) the overnight accommodation of business invitees on a temporary or
transient basis (such as a hotel, motel or corporate suites operation). All leases, rental and
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -15-
other occupancy agreements for Units shall expressly provide that they are subject in all
respects to the Governing Documents and that any failure by the tenant to comply with the
terms of such documents shall be a default under the lease. If any lease under this
Section does not contain the foregoing provisions, such provisions shall nevertheless be
deemed to be part of the lease and binding upon the Owner and all Tenants shall be
deemed bound by the restrictions stated herein. All leases shall be in writing. The
Association may request the names and contact information for all tenants including family
members who will occupy a Unit. If any lessee or occupant of a Home violates or permits
the violation by his/her guests and invitees of any provisions of the Governing Documents,
the Board may give notice to the lessee or occupant of the Home and the Owner thereof to
cease such violations. If the violation is thereafter repeated, the Board shall have the
authority, following Notice and Opportunity to be Heard, to impose a fine upon the Unit
Owner in accordance with a schedule adopted by the Board and each day that a violation
persists thereafter shall be deemed a separate violation for which the fine may be
separately assessed. The Association shall have a lien against the Owner’s Unit for any
fines not timely paid and any costs incurred by it in connection with such violation,
including reasonable attorneys’ fees, which may be collected and foreclosed by the
Association in the same manner as Assessments as provided herein.
The Board shall have the authority to enact Rules permitting rentals in a manner
that will not violate the requirements of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA or VA and to
prohibit such use if advisable to obtain project approval from such agencies.
10.1.3 Single-Family Residence. Only one (1) single-family residential
Home may be constructed or permitted to remain on a Unit.
10.1.4 Other Items. Except as expressly provided herein, no structure of a
temporary character, trailer, recreational vehicle, boat, boat trailer, panel truck, bus,
camper or camping trailer, tent, shed, shack, basement of any incomplete building, barn or
other outbuilding shall be either used or located on any Unit, or on any Street, at any time
or used as a Home either temporarily or permanently, unless permitted for temporary use
during construction/reconstruction of a Home on a Unit and such temporary structure and
use are permitted in advance by the ACC. No prefabricated buildings or structures of any
nature, specifically including mobile homes, shall be moved, placed, constructed or
otherwise located on any Unit for any period of time unless approved by the ACC in
advance. Temporary buildings or structures allowed during construction shall be removed
immediately after construction or upon request of the ACC, whichever occurs first.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Declarant may place construction and sales trailers on any
Unit which Declarant owns or on Common Elements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
boat, shed, recreational vehicle or other outbuilding may be located on a Unit if such item is
screened or located such that it is not visible from the Street and such item, structure,
screening and location are approved in advance by the ACC, which approval shall be in the
sole discretion of the ACC. No prior approval by the ACC shall be required if any such
trailer, camper, boat, or recreational vehicle is located or parked entirely within the garage
of the Home or within any other structure constructed previously with the approval of the
ACC.
Section 10.2 Conduct Restrictions. The following conduct restrictions shall apply to all
Owners and Authorized Users, except that they shall not apply to, or prohibit any conduct of,
Declarant as authorized by the CIC Act or the Governing Documents.
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -16-
10.2.1 Roads, Sidewalks, Walkways, Etc. The roads, sidewalks and
walkways used for access shall be used exclusively for normal ingress and egress. No
obstructions shall be placed therein unless permitted by the Board or the Rules.
10.2.2 Parking. Parking is not allowed on any portion of the
sidewalks, or any other portion of the Common Elements, except in designated parking
spaces, if any. No vehicles shall be permitted to park on the Streets within the Property for
a period exceeding twenty-four (24) hours (excluding weekends and holidays) without the
prior written permission of the Association. No vehicle may be parked on any Unit, except
in garages and on designated and approved driveways or parking areas, which areas shall
be hard-surfaced, unless otherwise permitted by the ACC. Any additional parking added to
a Unit after the initial landscaping shall be hard surfaces (unless otherwise approved by the
ACC in advance) and constructed only in accordance with a site plan approved by the
ACC. Unless otherwise expressly permitted herein, only the cars of guests and visitors
may be parked on the Streets (it being the intention to keep Street parking available as
much as possible for guests and visitors). All other vehicles of Owners and Occupants
shall be parked in garages or on driveways or other approved parking areas located
entirely within their Unit, as set forth herein. Owners and Occupants shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, first park their vehicles within available garage spaces within their
Unit and then on any available driveway or other approved external parking areas within
their Unit, and then on any Street. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any personal or workrelated vehicle of an Owner or Occupant is oversized in nature and does not fit within the
garage or on the driveway or other parking surface upon their Unit, then the ACC may
permit the parking of such over-sized vehicle on the Streets in its reasonable discretion;
provided, however, that the Owner or Occupant must park such vehicle on a Street
adjacent or as near as possible to their Unit and in no event shall any inoperative vehicle of
an Owner or Occupant be allowed to remain on the Street for more than 48 hours
(excluding weekends and holidays). No vehicle may be parked on a Street if it interferes
with or impedes the flow of traffic and use of the Street by others or if it interferes with a
Unit Owner’s ability to pull out of or into their approved driveways or parking areas.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, no parking shall be allowed on any
area or Street where the Map expressly restricts such parking or where “No Parking,”
“Emergency Vehicle Access,” “Fire Access” or similar signs or markings are otherwise
expressly posted in the Community and in Tract 997. No commercial vehicles, motor
homes, trailers, campers, boats and other recreational vehicles may be parked on any
Common Element except on a temporary basis for loading or unloading. The Association
may direct that any vehicle or other thing improperly parked or kept on any portion of the
Common Elements be removed at the risk and cost of the Owner thereof. No parking is
allowed on the Limited Common Element emergency vehicle access easement on Tract
997 or the access easement dedicated to the City leading to Tract 999.
10.2.3 Intentionally Deleted.
10.2.4 Parking in Unit/Garage Use Restrictions. No vehicle may be
parked in any Unit except in driveways and garages. No vehicle parked in any driveway
may extend into the streets or sidewalks of the Community or otherwise impede vehicular
or pedestrian traffic or access to any Unit. Owners should use their garages as the primary
vehicle storage and parking use; any other use of the garage must not impair the ability to
use it for parking if the effect causes additional street parking congestion.
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -17-
10.2.5 Further Regulation. The Board may adopt Rules further regulating
conduct on roads, sidewalks, driveways, parking spaces and other Common Elements,
including the parking and storage of recreational vehicles, campers, boats and the like, and
safe operation of vehicles. The Board may direct that any inoperative vehicle or anything
improperly parked or kept in a parking space, or elsewhere in the Community be removed,
and if it is not removed the Board may cause it to be removed at the risk and cost of the
Owner thereof.
10.2.6 Trash and Garbage. Each Owner must store trash and garbage
inside the garage of the Home or on the side of the Home if concealed from street view by
an approved fence, and set it out for collection in such locations and receptacles as are
authorized by the Board only on designated trash collection days, or as otherwise allowed
by the Rules. Each Owner is responsible for removing from the Community all trash and
garbage generated by that Owner that is not required to be picked up by a service. The
Board may adopt such Rules pertaining to such matters as in the judgment of the Board
are necessary for the safe, sanitary and efficient operation of the Community.
10.2.7 Signs. No sign of any kind may be displayed to the public view on
or from any Unit or Common Elements without the prior consent of the Board or pursuant
to the Rules. The Board may erect on the Common Elements a master directory of Units
including Units that are for sale or lease, and may regulate the size, appearance and
location of signs advertising Units for sale or lease.
10.2.8 Pets. No animals, livestock or poultry of any kind shall be raised,
bred or kept on any Unit except dogs, cats, birds, fish or other typical household pets;
provided they are not kept, bred or maintained for commercial purposes; provided further
that no more than two (2) dogs or two (2) cats shall be allowed per Unit, excluding fish,
birds and other pets that remain caged or housed exclusively indoors; and provided further
that the Board may permit in their sole discretion a third or fourth dog/cat (for a total of 4
such household pets) if the additional dog(s)/cat(s) are small in size and the Board
determines that such additional pet(s) will not adversely impact or be a nuisance within the
Community. Dogs shall be restrained to the Owner’s Unit and Yard and shall not be
allowed to run at large. All animals must be kept as domestic indoor pets. Leashed
animals are permitted within rights-of-way and authorized Common Elements when
accompanied by their Owners. Owners shall be responsible for cleaning up any and all of
their animals’ waste on the Property, including on the respective Owner’s Unit. If an Owner
fails to clean up their animals’ waste, the Association may, but shall not be obligated to,
take such action as may be necessary to clean up the animals’ waste and shall have the
right of entry for such purposes. Any costs incurred by the Association in connection with
such action shall be deemed to be a Special Assessment of the Owner whose animal(s)
created the waste. No animal shall be allowed to make an unreasonable amount of noise
or become a nuisance as determined by the Board, at its sole discretion. Notwithstanding
anything above, no animal that is considered dangerous, threatening or otherwise harmful
to others or that displays any such qualities after being within the Community shall be
permitted or allowed to remain within the Community after Notice and Opportunity to Be
Heard, after which the Board shall have the right to require removal of any animal from the
Unit which it finds in its sole discretion to violate this subsection.
10.2.9 Nuisances and Intrusive Activity. No noxious or offensive activity
shall be permitted in or upon any Unit or Common Elements, nor shall anything be done
thereon which may be or may become an annoyance or nuisance to the Community. No
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -18-
Owner may conduct, permit or allow any activity or the keeping of anything in the
Community that may unreasonably interfere with the other residents’ use or enjoyment of
their Units or the Common Elements; threaten the comfort, safety or security of any Owner;
or be or become a nuisance to other Owners. No use or activity that generates noise,
vibration, odors or traffic that would generally be considered unacceptable to households in
a single-family neighborhood is allowed. No Owner shall permit anything to be done or
kept upon a Unit or upon the Common Elements which would interfere with the right of
quiet enjoyment of other Owners or their Authorized Users. The Board may adopt such
Rules pertaining to such matters as in the judgment of the Board are necessary.
10.2.10 Hazardous Substances. No Owner may permit any Hazardous
Substance to be generated, processed, stored, transported, handled, or disposed of on,
under, in, or through the Owner’s Unit or any portion of the Common Elements. Each
Owner must indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Owners and the Association
from all fines, suits, procedures, claims, and actions of any kind arising out of or in any way
connected with any spills or discharges of Hazardous Substances or wastes arising from
the operation or use of the Unit or the property by the Owner, Tenants, or invitees of the
Unit. As used herein, the term “Hazardous Substance” means any hazardous, toxic, or
dangerous substance, waste, or material which is or becomes regulated under any federal,
state, or local statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or other law now or hereafter in effect
pertaining to environmental protection, contamination, or cleanup, including without
limitation any substance, waste, or material which now or hereafter is designated as a
“Hazardous Substance” under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (42 U.S.C. §9601, et seq.); or under any local or state rule
or regulation.
10.2.11 Conveyance by Owners; Notice Required. The right of an
Owner to transfer the Unit is not subject to any right of approval, disapproval, first refusal,
or similar restriction by the Association or the Board, or anyone acting on their behalf. An
Owner intending to convey a Unit must, however, deliver a written notice to the Board at
least two weeks before closing specifying (a) the Unit being sold; (b) the name and
address of the purchaser, the closing agent, and the title insurance company insuring the
purchaser’s interest; and (c) the estimated closing date. The Board has the right to notify
the purchaser, the title insurance company, and the closing agent of the amount of unpaid
Assessments and charges outstanding against the Unit, whether or not such information is
requested. Promptly upon the Conveyance of a Unit, the new Unit Owner must notify the
Association of (i) the date of the Conveyance; (ii) the Unit Owner’s name and address; and
(iii) the name and notice address of every first Mortgagee of the Unit. If requested, the
Association must notify each insurance company that has issued an insurance policy under
Article 20 of the name and address of the new Owner and request that the new Owner be
made an additional insured under such policy.
10.2.12 Construction. No dirt, debris, or other materials shall be allowed
to come off of any Units onto any Streets, Common Elements, other Units, or other parts of
the Property as a result of any construction or other activities. All Buildings shall be of new
construction (unless the ACC approves of recycled or “décor” vintage construction
materials in advance). No previously used houses or other buildings shall be moved onto a
Unit. The Unit shall be kept clean and clear of debris during construction. No Home may
be constructed on any Unit by other than a contractor licensed as a general contractor
under the statutes of the State of Washington without the prior approval of the ACC.
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -19-
10.2.13 Fences. Fences must comply with all applicable laws and
regulations and the Plat, and specifically any fence located within an easement must
comply with and is subject to the approval of the City and the utility purveyor as provided in
the Map. Fences may be erected on property lines, except that no fence shall be erected
between the Street and 5 feet from the front of the house. Nothing herein shall prevent the
erection or maintenance of a necessary or appropriate retaining wall and safety fencing on
top of said wall installed by Declarant or otherwise later approved in advance by the ACC.
No fence, wall, hedge or mass planting shall at any time extend higher than six feet (6')
above the ground, except for necessary and appropriate retaining walls or rockeries (and
associated safety fencing on top of the same) which conform to the City codes and are
installed by Declarant or otherwise later approved by the ACC in advance. With the
exception of necessary or appropriate safety fencing on top of walls, fences shall conform to
any applicable Rules concerning fencing, unless otherwise approved by the ACC. No wire
fences (other than safety fencing or cyclone fencing describe above) shall be used unless
approved by the ACC. If the Map or particular easement does not expressly restrict such
fencing, rear and side yard fences are permitted to be located within easements created or
dedicated on the face of the Map with the prior written approval of the ACC, provided that
such fencing must not interfere with or obstruct the purpose of the easement or any
facilities therein. If such a fence or portion of a fence is ever placed within any easements
in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the Owner of said fence shall be required to
temporarily remove the same at its cost if the party benefitted by such easement requires
removal to carry out activities permitted by the easement (e.g., maintenance of utilities) or
required to permanently remove the fence at its cost if such benefitted party determines the
fence unreasonably interferes with or obstructs its easement rights.
10.2.14 Lighting. All area lighting shall be designed and positioned to
ensure that the light source is not visible from any other Homes or, if visible, is angled
downward so as to adequately mitigate the effect of any light spill over onto adjacent Units
(whether or not any visible light is adequately mitigated shall be determined by the ACC in
its sole discretion for the protection of the Owners within and for the overall harmony of the
ACC). Decorative holiday lighting may be installed no more than thirty (30) days before and
shall be removed no later than thirty (30) days after the date of the holiday.
10.2.15 Yard Art. No yard pieces or yard art (including but not limited to
sculptures, statues, and other freestanding or attached works, whether for decoration or
otherwise) that are more than twelve inches (12") tall or twelve inches (12") wide shall be
permitted outside of the Home and within view from the Street without prior written approval
of the ACC. Flags of the United States or the State of Washington are not considered yard
art hereunder and are permitted, provided, however, the Association may place reasonable
restrictions on the time, place and manner of display as permitted by federal and state law.

11.1.1 Grounds; Maintenance of Grounds. The entire front landscaping
for each Unit with a Home thereon shall be installed prior to occupancy in accordance with
the plan submitted to the ACC. The entire landscaping, including the remaining portions of
the side and rear yard, shall be installed within six (6) months. To the extent applicable
each Owner shall be responsible for removing the PVC pipe containing the cable
connection wires located on their Unit and either burying the cable wires or installing a
landscape box and landscaping to screen the cable connection wires and box. Each Owner
shall be responsible for the maintenance and repair of all parking areas, driveways,

Owner from recovering (from any person liable therefor) damages to which such Owner
might be entitled for any act or omission to act requiring an expenditure by the Owner for
the maintenance and repair of the parking area, driveway, walkway, and/or landscaping on
Owner’s Unit. Such maintenance and repair of the Owner’s Unit shall include, without
limitation:
11.1.1.1 Parking and Other Areas. Maintenance of all parking
areas, driveways and walkways in a clean and safe condition, including paving and
repairing or resurfacing such areas when necessary with the type of material originally

the approved and constructed storm drain system and surface flows without the written
consent of the ACC.
11.1.1.5 Hillsides and Other. Maintenance of all hillsides, slopes
and swales in their as designed and completed condition, and which shall not be changed

within them to collect and direct storm water run-off. Where such Retaining Walls exist, the
removal or deterioration of such Retaining Walls will affect the Units and other real property
benefitted by and/or along the same slope supported by such Retaining Walls. No Owner
whose Unit is benefitted or burdened by any such Retaining Wall shall alter, damage,
destroy or remove such Retaining Wall or any part of it without the prior written consent of
the City and the consent of the other Owners of Units and real property affected by such
Retaining Wall. The Owners affected by each Retaining Wall shall be jointly and equally
responsible for all maintenance and repair of such Retaining Wall as necessary to keep the
same structurally sound and in good repair; provided, however, that if the act of any Owner
or their Occupants, guests, invitees or other representatives damages or causes excess
deterioration to any Retaining Wall, the applicable Owner shall be responsible for all costs
to repair such damage and deterioration. If any Owner disputes which Retaining Wall(s)
affect their Unit or what work is necessary or appropriate under this Section, the Owner
may submit its dispute to the Association and the Association shall engage a neutral
professionally licensed geotechnical engineer to make such determination, which shall
then be final. The Association shall pass along the cost of such geotechnical engineer to
the Owner who was incorrect in the dispute, as a Special Assessment. Each Owner shall
permit reasonable access to and use of his or her Unit as necessary or appropriate for all
maintenance and repair work on any Retaining Wall called for under this Section. Any
work performed on any Retaining Wall must be permitted in accordance with all City rules,
must be performed by a licensed and insured contractor, must first be reviewed and
approved by a professionally licensed geotechnical engineer, and all work must comply
with the recommendations of such engineer.
11.1.2 Remedies for Failure to Perform Owner Maintenance Obligations. If
any Owner fails to perform the maintenance and repair obligations required herein, then the
Board after fifteen (15) days’ prior written notice to such delinquent Owner, shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to perform such maintenance and repair and to charge the
delinquent Owner and his/her Unit for the cost of such work together with interest thereon
from the date of the Association’s advancement of funds for such work to the date of
reimbursement of the Association by Owner. If the delinquent Owner fails to reimburse the
Association for such costs within ten (10) days after demand therefore, the Association
may, at any time after such advance, record a claim of lien signed by an authorized agent
of the Association for the amount of such charge together with interest thereon and enforce
the Association lien in accordance with the provisions of this Declaration. The Association
lien and the rights to foreclose thereunder shall be in addition to all other rights and
remedies which the Board may have hereunder or in equity or at law, including any suit to
recover a money judgment for unpaid Assessments.
Section 11.2 Association’s Maintenance and Repair Responsibilities. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 11.1, the Association is responsible for the maintenance, repair, and
replacement of the Common Elements, including, without limitation, (i) open space Tracts; (ii)
Street Landscaping, including landscaped areas in the public right-of-way; (ii) all Structures, walls,
Entry Monuments (if any), and other improvements and landscaping on the Common Elements,
provided, however, maintenance and repair of any six (6) foot cedar fencing, or portion thereof,
bordering a Common Element and a particular Unit shall be the responsibility of such Unit Owner in
accordance with Section 11.1 above; and (iii) all utility installations and storm water facilities
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -22-
serving the Community and not the responsibility of an Owner or a governmental entity. The
Association must keep such items in good repair and in a neat, clean and sanitary condition, in
compliance with applicable Laws, the Governing Documents and the Community-Wide Standard.
Section 11.3 Summary of Maintenance Responsibilities. The maintenance
responsibilities of the Owners and Association are summarized in Schedule D attached hereto. In
the event of any conflict between the text of this Article 11 and the schedule, the text shall control.
Section 11.4 Transfer of Responsibility. The Board may adopt Rules transferring
responsibility to maintain certain Limited Common Elements to the Owners if it determines that the
Owners will regularly, properly and consistently maintain the Limited Common Elements, and that
there is little risk of damage to the Community or cost to the Association from such transfer of
maintenance responsibility. The Association may modify or revoke any such Rules if it determines
that modification or revocation is in the best interest of the Community.
Section 11.5 Construction and Alterations; Architectural Control. Although the Owners
have the responsibility for maintenance, repair and replacement of their Units, Homes and Yards
as set forth in this Article 11, the Board shall have the right to regulate any new Structures and any
alterations to existing Structures to ensure that they (i) comply with the Governing Documents; and
(ii) are harmonious with the other Homes and improvements in the Community. Accordingly,
except as set forth in Governing Documents, no Owner may construct or install a new Structure or
alter any portion of an existing Structure, without the prior written approval of the Board.
11.5.1 Scope of Regulation and Authority. For the avoidance of doubt,
the authority of the Board under this Section 11.5 includes regulation of: (i) the location,
size, design and appearance of Structures; (ii) the materials and colors of exterior features
and surfaces of Structures, including siding, roofing, windows and doors; (iii) the placement
and appearance of ancillary items such as antennae, security devices, and hardscaping;
and (iv) other factors relating to compliance with the Governing Documents or harmony
with the other Homes and improvements in the Community. The Board shall not have
authority to (i) regulate the maintenance, repair or reconstruction of a Structure that does
not change its location, size or appearance; or (ii) regulate any landscaping (other than
hardscaping) on a Unit unless it alters/interferes with the plan requirements of the
Community. The Board shall have the authority to adopt Rules to implement and clarify the
scope, standards and processes under this Section 11.5 and to appoint, pursuant to the

Board determines that a reconciliation would not result in a material savings to any Unit Owner. At
least annually, the Association shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, a financial statement of the

terms of office of members of the Board. The Board may, in accordance with the Bylaws, fill
vacancies in its membership for the unexpired portion of any term.
Section 15.7 Limitation of Liability; Indemnification. The liability of each director, officer
and committee member, including the Declarant when acting in any such capacity, shall be limited
as set forth in the Association’s Articles. Each director, officer and committee member, including
the Declarant when acting in any such capacity, shall be entitled to indemnity, reimbursement of
expenses and advances of expenses as set forth in the Association’s Articles.
Section 15.8 Lawsuits or Arbitration Proceedings.
15.8.1 General. The Association may institute, defend, or intervene in
litigation or in arbitration, mediation, or administrative proceedings or any other legal
proceeding (“Proceedings”) in its own name on behalf of itself or on behalf of two or more
Unit Owners, in a representative capacity, on matters affecting the Community, but any
action on behalf of Unit Owners shall not convert any individual claims or legal rights that
the Unit Owners may have into claims or rights of the Association.
15.8.2 Notice. The Board must carefully evaluate the potential costs
and risks to the Unit Owners before committing the Unit Owners to a course of action in
any Proceedings. The Board shall evaluate those matters and promptly provide notice in a
Record to the Units Owners about any legal proceedings in which the Association is a
party other than Proceedings involving the enforcement of Rules or to recover unpaid
Assessments due to the Association. The notice shall describe: (i) the principal amount
sought to be recovered; (ii) the estimated attorneys’ fees which will be chargeable to the
Association; (iii) the basis on which the attorneys’ fees will be paid (for example, hourly, flat
fee or contingent); (iv) the estimated cost of all witnesses or investigators including
bookkeepers, accountants, consultants, investigators, contractors, and experts; (v) the
nature of the Association’s claims and defenses and the amount at issue; and (vi) the
negative consequences the Unit Owners could suffer by reason of the proposed
Proceedings, including the likelihood of special Assessments and the impact of the
litigation on Unit sales or refinancings while the Proceedings are pending.
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -33-
ARTICLE 16 BUDGET AND ASSESSMENTS
Section 16.1 Fiscal Year. The Board may adopt such fiscal year for the Association as
it deems to be convenient. Unless another year is adopted, the fiscal year will be the calendar
year.
Section 16.2 Preparation of Budget. Not less than 30 days before the end of the fiscal
year in which Assessments are collected, the Board shall prepare a budget for the Association for
the coming year. The budget must include: (i) the projected income to the Association by category;
(ii) the projected Common Expenses and those Specially Allocated Expenses that are subject to
being budgeted, both by category; (iii) the amount of Assessments per Unit and the date the
Assessments are due; (iv) the amount of regular Assessments budgeted for contribution to the
reserve account; (v) a statement of whether the Association has a reserve study that meets the
requirements of the CIC Act and, if so, the extent to which the budget meets or deviates from the
recommendations of that reserve study; and (vi) the current deficiency or surplus in reserve funding
expressed on a per unit basis. The Budget shall also take into account any surplus or deficit
carried over from the preceding year, and make provision for reasonable reserves for
contingencies. The Board need not reserve for items that can reasonably be funded from cash
flow or borrowing, and need not adopt a “fully funded” plan or contribution and may adopt such plan
and contribution rate as it deems appropriate in its reasonable discretion. The Board may at any
suitable time require the commencement of contributions to such reserve accounts. The Board
need not adopt a new budget prior to the Transition Date, and any budget adopted during such
period may be based on the actual expenses for the Association and need not provide for
accumulation of reserves.
Section 16.3 Ratification of Budget. Within 30 days after adoption of any proposed
budget for the Community, the Board shall provide a copy of the budget to all the Owners and shall
set a date for a meeting of the Owners to consider ratification of the budget not fewer than 14 or
more than 50 days after mailing of the summary. Unless at that meeting the Owners to which a
majority of the votes in the Association are allocated reject the budget, the budget and the
Assessments against the Units included in the Budget is ratified, whether or not a quorum is
present. In the event the proposed budget is rejected, or the required notice is not given, the
periodic budget last ratified by the Unit Owners shall be continued until such time as the Unit
Owners ratify a subsequent budget proposed by the Board. If the Board proposes a supplemental
budget during any fiscal year, such budget shall not take effect unless ratified by the Unit Owners
in accordance with this Section 16.3.
Section 16.4 Revisions to Budget. The Board may revise the budget and any
Assessments based thereon, from time to time for any reason, including non-payment of any
Owner’s Assessments. Any revision to the budget is, however, subject to the notice requirements
and the right of Owners to ratify the revised budget set forth in Section 16.3.
Section 16.5 Assessments for Common Expenses. The sums required by the
Association for Common Expenses as reflected in the annual budget and any supplemental budget
shall be divided into installments to be paid periodically, as determined by the Board, over the
period to be covered by the budget or supplemental budget. The Tract 999 Costs described in
Section 9.9 shall be included in the Common Expenses. The Assessment for Common Expenses
for each Unit shall be the sum of (a) the Common Expense Liability of that Unit multiplied by the
total periodic installment for Common Expenses (except Specially Allocated Expenses) for all
Units; and (b) any Specially Allocated Expenses of that Unit. Assessments shall commence
against all Units that have been created by this Declaration no later than the date of the first
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -34-
Conveyance of a Unit to an Owner other than Declarant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Declarant may delay the commencement of Assessments for some or all Common Expenses or
Specially Allocated Expenses beyond such date, in which event the Declarant must pay all of the
Common Expenses or Specially Allocated Expenses that have been delayed during the period of
delay. The Declarant may exercise the right to delay Assessments for any Units whether initially
created or subsequently created pursuant to a Development Right to create Units. If Declarant has
paid insurance premiums prior to the commencement of Assessments, it shall be entitled to a
refund from the Association of any unearned premium for the period after commencement of
Assessments. If the Association does not have adequate working capital at the commencement of
Assessments to reimburse the Declarant for the unearned premiums, it may deliver a promissory
note to the Declarant and pay the balance due over time.
Section 16.6 Specially Allocated Expenses. There are no Specially Allocated
Expenses.
Section 16.7 Misconduct. To the extent that any Common Expense is caused by the
negligence of any Owner or Authorized User of any Unit, the Association may assess that expense
against the Owner’s Unit.
Section 16.8 Special Assessments. For those Common Expenses which cannot
reasonably be calculated and paid on a periodic basis, the Board may levy special Assessments
for such expenses against the Units, subject to ratification by the Owners pursuant to Section 16.3.
Section 16.9 Reserve Studies. The Association shall obtain reserve studies and
updated reserve studies as required by the CIC Act. An initial reserve study must be prepared by a
reserve study professional and based upon either a reserve study professional’s visual site
inspection of completed improvements or a review of plans and specifications of or for unbuilt
improvements, or both when construction of some but not all of the improvements is complete. An
updated reserve study must be prepared annually and need not be completed each year by a
reserve study professional; provided, however, that an updated reserve study must be prepared at
least every third year by a reserve study professional and based upon a visual site inspection
conducted by the reserve study professional. Until the expiration of all warranties given by or
imposed upon the Declarant, and the time period for filing any claims against the Declarant, the
Board shall contemporaneously send a copy of each reserve study to the Declarant at the address
specified in Section 26.1, or such other address as the Declarant may specify in a Record to the
Association from time to time.
Section 16.10 Creation of Reserve Account. Once Assessments for replacement
reserves are collected, the Board shall establish one or more accounts for the deposit of reserve
contributions. Any reserve account must be an income-earning account maintained under the direct
control of the Board, and the Board is responsible for administering the reserve account. The
operation of the reserve account and any Assessments for contribution to the reserve account shall
be further governed by this Article 16 and the Bylaws.
Section 16.11 Withdrawals from Reserve Accounts. The Board may withdraw funds from
the Association’s reserve accounts to pay for unforeseen or unbudgeted costs that are unrelated to
replacement costs of the reserve components. Any such withdrawal must be recorded in the
minute books of the Association. The Board must give notice of any such withdrawal to each Unit
Owner and adopt a repayment schedule not to exceed twenty-four months unless the Board
determines that repayment within twenty-four months would impose an unreasonable burden on
the Unit Owners. The Board must provide to Unit Owners along with the annual budget adopted in
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -35-
accordance with Section 16.2 of this Declaration (a) notice of any such withdrawal; (b) a statement
of the current deficiency in reserve funding expressed on a per Unit basis; and (c) the repayment
plan. The Board may withdraw funds from the reserve account without satisfying the notification of
repayment requirements under this section to pay for replacement costs of reserve components not
included in the reserve study.
Section 16.12 Payment of Assessments. On a date as the Board may establish by Rule,
each Owner shall pay or cause to be paid to the treasurer or designated agent of the Association
all Assessments against the Unit due for that period, as determined by the Board. Any
Assessment that is not paid when due will be subject to late charges, interest charges and
collection adopted by the Board pursuant to Section 17.9.
Section 16.13 Proceeds Belong to Association. All Assessments and other receipts
received by the Association on behalf of the Community shall belong to the Association.
Section 16.14 Failure to Assess. Any failure by the Board or the Association to make the
budgets and Assessments hereunder before the expiration of any year for the ensuing year shall
not be deemed a waiver or modification in any respect of the provisions of this Declaration, or a
release of the Owner from the obligation to pay Assessments during that or any subsequent year,
and the Assessments amounts established for the preceding year shall continue until new
Assessments are established.
Section 16.15 Certificate of Unpaid Assessments. Upon the request of any Owner or
Mortgagee of the Owner’s Unit, the Board must furnish a statement signed by an officer or
authorized agent of the Association stating the amount of unpaid Assessments against that Unit.
The Association must furnish the statement within 15 days after receiving the request. The
statement shall be binding on the Association, the Board and every Unit Owner, unless and to the
extent known by the recipient to be false. The Board may establish a reasonable fee to be charged
to reimburse it for the cost of preparing the statement.
Section 16.16 Recalculation of Assessments. If Common Expense Liabilities are
reallocated, Assessments and any installment thereof not yet due shall be recalculated in
accordance with the reallocated liabilities. The Board shall have the discretion to determine when
to impose the recalculated Assessments, but in no event, shall the Board delay imposition beyond
the fiscal year during which the Common Expense Liabilities were reallocated.
Section 16.17 Initial Contribution to Working Capital. The first purchaser (as defined in
the CIC Act) of any Unit shall, at the time of closing, pay to the Association (or the Declarant as set
forth below), in addition to other amounts due, a non-refundable initial contribution to the
Association’s working capital in an amount to be determined by Declarant. The Declarant shall not
use any such contributions to defray expenses that are the obligation of Declarant.
ARTICLE 17 LIEN AND COLLECTION OF ASSESSMENTS
Section 17.1 Assessments Are a Lien; Priority.
17.1.1 The Association has a lien on a Unit for any unpaid Assessment
levied against a Unit from the time the Assessment is due.
17.1.2 A lien under this Article 17 shall be prior to all other liens and
encumbrances on a Unit except: (i) liens and encumbrances recorded before the recording
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -36-
of this Declaration; (ii) a Mortgage on the Unit recorded before the date on which the
unpaid Assessment became due; and (iii) liens for real estate taxes and other
governmental assessments or charges against the Unit.
17.1.3 Except as provided in this Section 17.1.3, the lien shall also be
prior to the Mortgages described in Section 17.1.2(ii) to the extent of an amount equal to:
17.1.3.1 Assessments (whether specially allocated or not) for
Common Expenses, excluding any amounts for capital improvements, based on the
periodic budgets adopted by the Association pursuant to Article 16, which would have
become due in the absence of acceleration during the six months immediately preceding
the institution of proceedings to foreclose either the Association’s lien or a Mortgage
described in Section 17.1.2(ii); plus
17.1.3.2 The Association’s actual costs and reasonable attorneys’
fees incurred in foreclosing its lien but incurred after the giving of the notice described in
Section 17.1.3.3; provided, however, that the costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees that will
have priority under this Section 17.1.3.2 shall not exceed $2,000 or an amount equal to the
amounts described in Section 17.1.3.1, whichever is less.
17.1.3.3 The notice must satisfy the requirements of Section 515
of the CIC Act.
17.1.4 Recording of this Declaration constitutes recorded notice and
perfection of the lien for Assessments; however, the Association may record a notice of
claim of lien for Assessments in the real estate records of the county in which the
Community is located. Such recording shall not constitute the notice referred to in Section
17.1.3.3.
Section 17.2 Judicial Foreclosure. A lien arising under this Article 17 may be enforced
judicially by the Association or its authorized representative in the manner set forth in Chapter
61.12 RCW, subject to any rights of redemption under Chapter 6.23 RCW. Upon an express
waiver in the complaint of any right to a deficiency judgment in a judicial foreclosure action, the
period of redemption shall be eight months.
Section 17.3 Non-Judicial Foreclosure. A lien arising under this Article 17 may be
foreclosed non-judicially in the manner set forth in Chapter 61.24 RCW for non-judicial foreclosure
of deeds of trust. For the purpose of preserving the Association’s non-judicial foreclosure option,
this Declaration shall be considered to create a grant of each Unit in trust to Chicago Title
Company or other title company or their successors or assigns (“Trustee”), to secure the
obligations of each Unit Owner to the Association for the payment of Assessments. Each Unit
Owner shall retain the right to possession of its Unit so long as Grantor is not in default of an
obligation to pay Assessments. The Trustee shall have a power of sale with respect to each Unit,
which becomes operative in the case of a default in a Unit Owner’s obligation to pay Assessments.
The Units are not used principally for agricultural or farming purposes. If the Association forecloses
its lien non-judicially pursuant to this Section 17.3, it shall not be entitled to the lien priority over
Mortgages provided in Section 17.1.3 and shall be subject to the limits on deficiency judgments
under Chapter 61.24 RCW.
Section 17.4 Receiver During Foreclosure. In an action to collect Assessments or to
foreclose on a lien on a Unit, the Association shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver to
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -37-
collect all sums due and owing to the Unit Owner before commencement of the action or during the
pendency of the action. The receivership shall be governed by Chapter 7.60 RCW. During the
pendency of the action, the court may order the receiver to pay sums held by the receiver to the
Association for any Assessments against the Unit. The exercise by the Association of the
foregoing rights shall not affect the priority of preexisting liens on the Unit.
Section 17.5 Effect of Foreclosure. The Association or its authorized representative
shall have the power to purchase the Unit at the Foreclosure sale and to acquire, hold, lease,
mortgage, or convey the same. Nothing in this Article 17 shall prohibit the Association from taking
a deed in lieu of Foreclosure. Except as provided in Section 17.1.3, the holder of a Mortgage or
other purchaser of a Unit who obtains the right of possession of a Unit through Foreclosure shall
not be liable for any Assessments or installments thereof that became due prior to such right of
possession. Such unpaid Assessments shall be deemed to be Common Expenses collectible from
all the Owners, including such Mortgagee or other purchaser of the Unit. Foreclosure of a
Mortgage does not relieve the prior Owner of personal liability for Assessments accruing against
the Unit prior to the date of such sale.
Section 17.6 Assessments Are Personal Obligations. In addition to constituting a lien
on the Unit, all sums assessed by the Association chargeable to any Unit, including all charges in
this Article 17, shall be the personal obligation of the Owner of the Unit when the Assessments are
made. Suit to recover personal judgment for any delinquent Assessments shall be maintainable
without foreclosing or waiving the liens securing them.
Section 17.7 Extinguishment of Lien and Personal Liability. A lien for unpaid
Assessments and the personal liability for payment of Assessments are extinguished unless
proceedings to enforce the lien or collect the debt are instituted within six years after the full
amount of the Assessments sought to be recovered becomes due.
Section 17.8 Joint and Several Liability. In addition to constituting a lien on the Unit,
each Assessment shall be the joint and several obligation of the Owner or Owners of the Unit to
which the same is assessed as of the time the Assessment is due. In a voluntary Conveyance,
other than by foreclosure, the grantee of a Unit shall be jointly and severally liable with the grantor
for all unpaid Assessments against the grantor up to the time of the grantor’s Conveyance, without
prejudice to the grantee’s right to recover from the grantor the amounts paid by the grantee
therefore. Suit to recover a personal judgment for any delinquent Assessment shall be
maintainable in any court of competent jurisdiction without foreclosing or waving the lien securing
such sums.
Section 17.9 Late Charges and Interest on Delinquent Assessments; Notice to Eligible
Mortgagees. The Association may from time to time establish reasonable late charges and a rate
of interest to be charged, not to exceed the maximum rate calculated under RCW 19.52.020 on all
subsequent delinquent Assessments or installments thereof. If the Association has not established
such a rate, delinquent Assessments shall bear interest from the date of delinquency at the
maximum rate permitted under RCW 19.52.020 on the date on which the Assessments became
delinquent. For any Assessments delinquent by more than 60 days, the Association shall provide
written notice to the Eligible Mortgagee of such Unit of the Owner’s failure to timely pay the
amounts due to the Association.
Section 17.10 Recovery of Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. The Association shall be entitled
to recover any costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with the collection of
delinquent Assessments, whether or not such collection activities result in a suit being commenced
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -38-
or prosecuted to judgment. In addition, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover costs and
reasonable attorneys’ fees if it prevails on appeal and in the enforcement of a judgment.
Section 17.11 Limitations on Foreclosure Proceedings. The Association may not
commence an action to Foreclose a lien on a Unit under this Article 17 unless: (i) the Unit Owner,
at the time the action is commenced, owes a sum equivalent to at least three months of
Assessments, and (ii) the Board approves commencement of a Foreclosure action specifically
against that Unit. Every aspect of a collection, Foreclosure, sale or other conveyance under this
Article 17, including the method, advertising, time, date, place and terms must be commercially
reasonable.
Section 17.12 Security Deposit. An Owner who has been chronically delinquent in
paying its Assessments may, from time to time, be required by the Board, after Notice and
Opportunity to be Heard, to make and maintain a security deposit not in excess of three months’
estimated Assessments, which shall be collected and shall be subject to penalties for non-payment
as are other Assessments. The deposit shall be held in a separate fund, credited to such Owner,
and may be resorted to at any time when such Owner is 10 days or more delinquent in paying
Assessments.
Section 17.13 Remedies Cumulative. The remedies provided herein are cumulative, and
the Board may pursue them, and any other remedies which may be available under law although
not expressed herein, either concurrently or in any order.
ARTICLE 18 ENFORCEMENT OF GOVERNING DOCUMENTS
Section 18.1 Rights of Action. Each Owner and its Authorized Users and the
Association shall comply with the Governing Documents and the proper decisions of the Board.
The Declarant shall enjoy all the rights and assume all the obligations of an Owner as to each
unsold Unit in the Community owned by the Declarant. The Association acting on behalf of the
Owners or any Owner acting on its own behalf may bring an action to recover sums due or
damages, or for injunctive relief, or any or all of them, against any party who fails to comply with the
Governing Documents and the proper decisions of the Board.
Section 18.2 Additional Rights. In addition to any rights authorized by the CIC Act, the
Board may, after Notice and Opportunity to Be Heard, take any of the following actions against any
party who fails to comply with the Governing Documents and the proper decisions of the Board:
18.2.1 Require an Owner, at its own expense, to stop work on, and
remove, any improvement from such Owner’s Unit or other areas of the Community in
violation of the Governing Documents and to restore the property to its previous condition
and, upon failure of the Owner to do so, the Board or its designee shall have the right to
enter the property, remove the violation and restore the property to substantially the same
condition as previously existed and any such action shall not be deemed a trespass;
18.2.2 Levy Assessments to cover costs incurred by the Association to
cure a violation of the Governing Documents;
18.2.3 Apply a security deposit posted by an Owner to any unpaid
charges or Assessments;
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -39-
18.2.4 Suspend any right or privilege of a Unit Owner who fails to pay
an Assessment, but the Association may not (i) deny a Unit Owner or other occupant
access to the Owner’s Unit; (ii) suspend a Unit Owner’s right to vote; or (iii) withhold
services provided to a Unit or a Unit Owner by the Association if withholding the service
would endanger the health, safety, or property of any Person; and
18.2.5 Exercise self-help or take action to abate any violation of the
Governing Documents.
Notice and Opportunity to Be Heard shall not be required in an emergency situation or in regard to
the removal of vehicles or items that are in violation of parking Rules.
Section 18.3 Remedies Cumulative; Attorneys’ Fees. All remedies set forth in the
Governing Documents shall be cumulative of any remedies available at law or in equity. In any
action to enforce the Governing Documents, if the Association or Owner prevails, it shall be entitled
to recover all costs, including, without limitation, its attorneys’ fees and court costs, reasonably
incurred in such action.
Section 18.4 Enforcement Discretion; No Waiver. The decision to pursue enforcement
action in any particular case shall be left to the judgment of the Board, except that the Board shall
not be arbitrary or capricious in taking enforcement action. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing sentence, the Board may determine that, under the circumstances of a particular case:
18.4.1 The Association’s position does not justify taking action or
further action;
18.4.2 The covenant, restriction or Rule being enforced is, or is likely to
be, construed as inconsistent with applicable law;
18.4.3 Although a violation may exist or may have occurred, it is not so
material as to be objectionable to a reasonable Person or to justify expending the
Association’s resources; or
18.4.4 It is not in the Association’s best interests to pursue enforcement
action.
Such a decision shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of the Association to enforce such
provision at a later time under other circumstances or preclude the Association from enforcing any
other covenant, restriction or Rule. The receipt by the Board of payment of an Assessment from an
Owner, with knowledge of a breach by the Owner, shall not be a waiver of the breach. No waiver
by the Board of any requirement shall be effective unless expressed in a Record and signed for by
the Board. This Section 18.4 also extends and applies to the Declarant.
Section 18.5 Notice and Opportunity to Be Heard. Whenever this Declaration requires
that an action of the Board be taken after Notice and Opportunity to Be Heard, the following
procedure shall be observed: The Board shall give written notice of the proposed action to all
Owners, Tenants or occupants of Units whose interest would be significantly affected by the
proposed action. The notice shall include a general statement of the proposed action and the date,
time and place of the hearing, which shall be not less than five days from the date notice is
delivered by the Board. At the hearing, the affected Person shall have the right, personally or by a
representative, to give testimony orally, in a Record or both (as specified in the notice), subject to
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -40-
reasonable Rules of procedure established by the Board to ensure a prompt and orderly resolution
of the issues. Such evidence shall be considered in making the decision but shall not bind the
Board. The affected Person shall be notified of the decision in the same manner in which notice of
the meeting was given.
ARTICLE 19 TORT AND CONTRACT LIABILITY
Section 19.1 Declarant Liability. An Owner is not liable, solely by reason of being an
Owner, for an injury or damage arising out of the condition or use of the Common Elements.
Neither the Association nor any Owner except the Declarant is liable for the Declarant’s torts in
connection with any part of the Community which the Declarant has the responsibility to maintain.
An action alleging a wrong done by the Association must be brought against the Association and
not against any Owner. An Owner is not precluded from bringing an action contemplated by this
Section 19.1 because it is a Unit Owner or a director or officer of the Association.
Section 19.2 Limitation of Liability for Utility Failure. Except to the extent covered by
insurance obtained by the Association, neither the Association, the Board, the Managing Agent nor
the Declarant shall be liable to any Unit Owner for:
19.2.1 the failure of any utility or other service to be obtained and paid
for by the Board;
19.2.2 injury or damage to Person or property caused by the elements,
or resulting from electricity, water, rain, dust, mold or mildew which may leak, travel or flow
from outside of any building; from any Unit, Common Element or part of the building; from
any pipes, drains, conduits, appliances, or equipment; or from any other place; or
19.2.3 inconvenience or discomfort resulting from any action taken to
comply with the Governing Documents or any law, ordinance or orders of a governmental
authority. No diminution or abatement of Assessments shall be claimed or allowed for any
such utility or service failure, or for such injury or damage, or for such inconvenience or
discomfort.
Section 19.3 Limitation of Personal Liability; Indemnification. Each director and officer
of the Association shall be insulated from liability for its conduct as a director or officer of the
Association to the extent set forth in Article 8 of the Articles and shall be entitled to indemnification
to the extent set forth in Article 9 of the Articles.
ARTICLE 20 INSURANCE
Section 20.1 Required Insurance. Commencing not later than the time of the first
Conveyance of a Unit to a Person other than the Declarant, the Association shall maintain in its
own name, to the extent reasonably available and subject to reasonable deductibles, insurance
meeting the requirements of this Article 20. The Association may, however, delay procurement of
fidelity insurance until the election of the Board at the Transition Meeting. All insurance must be
obtained from insurance carriers who are generally acceptable for similar projects, are authorized
to do business in the State of Washington and meet the acceptability criteria of Fannie Mae,
Freddie Mac, HUD and VA. The Board shall review at least annually the adequacy of the
Association’s insurance coverage. The Board shall promptly notify the Unit Owners if the required
property or liability insurance is not reasonably available. All insurance policies shall provide that
coverage may not be cancelled or substantially reduced without at least 60 days’ prior written
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -41-
Notice (10 days for cancellation for nonpayment of premium) to the Association and Eligible
Mortgagees.
Section 20.2 Property Insurance Requirements. The Association shall maintain
property insurance written on a “special form” of coverage. The property insurance shall cover (i)
all Common Elements (including Limited Common Elements, if any) and all real estate that must
become Common Elements, (ii) to the extent not described in the foregoing clause, all installed
machinery and equipment and personal property owned by the Association and located outside of
a Unit (including but not limited to furniture, media equipment, and appliances used for
refrigerating, ventilating, cooking, dishwashing or laundering), and (iii) all other personal property of
the Association. The property insurance shall insure against all risks of direct physical loss and
may, but need not, include damage caused by earthquakes or terrorism. The amount of insurance
shall not be less than 100% of the current replacement cost of the insured property at the time the
insurance is purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations and
other items normally excluded from property policies. To ensure adequate property insurance
coverage, the Board shall periodically obtain insurance replacement cost appraisals of any
buildings and personal property for which insurance is required under this Section 20.2.
Section 20.3 Liability Insurance Requirements. The Association shall maintain
commercial general liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, which provides
coverage for bodily injury and property damage resulting from the operation, maintenance or use of
the Common Elements in an amount of at least $1,000,000 for any single occurrence and
$2,000,000 aggregate and which contains a specific endorsement to preclude the insurer’s denial
of a Unit Owner’s claim because of the negligent act of the Association or other Unit Owners.
Section 20.4 Fidelity Insurance Requirements. The Association shall maintain, or
require its Managing Agent to maintain, fidelity insurance naming the Association and its officers,
directors, trustees and employees, any Managing Agent, and all other Persons who handle or are
responsible for handling funds held or administered by the Association, whether or not the Person
receives compensation for services, as insured. The bond shall contain waivers of any defense
based upon the exclusion of Persons who serve without compensation from any definitions of
“employee” or similar expression. The policy must provide minimum limits at least equal to the
larger of (i) the highest amount of funds, including reserve funds, that the Association is expected
to hold at any time while the policy is in force, or (ii) three months of the expected aggregate
Assessments for the policy term, plus reserve funds. There shall be no requirement to obtain a
fidelity bond prior to the Transition Meeting.
Section 20.5 Additional Insurance Requirements. The insurance policies obtained
pursuant to Section 20.2 shall:
20.5.1 Provide that the Association is the named insured, and that each
Unit Owner is an insured under the policy with respect to liability arising out of the Owner’s
interest in the Common Elements or membership in the Association;
20.5.2 Provide that the insurer waives its right to subrogation under the
policy as to any and all claims against the Association, the Owner of any Unit and/or their
respective agents, employees or Tenants, and members of their household, and of any
defenses based upon coinsurance or upon invalidity arising from the acts of the insured;
20.5.3 Provide that no act or omission by any Unit Owner, unless
acting within the scope of the Owner’s authority on behalf of the Association, or any failure
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -42-
of the Association to comply with any warranty or condition regarding any portion of the
premises over which the Association has no direct control, will void the policy or be a
condition to recovery under the policy; and
20.5.4 Provide that if, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is
other insurance in the name of a Unit Owner covering the same risk covered by the policy,
the Association’s policy provides primary insurance, and that the liability of the insurer
thereunder shall not be affected by, and the insurer shall not claim any right to set-off,
counterclaims, apportionment, proration, contribution or assessment by reason of, any
other insurance obtained by or for any Unit Owner or any Mortgagee.
Section 20.6 Adjustment of Losses; Insurance Trustee; Power of Attorney. Any loss
covered by the insurance described in Section 20.2 must be adjusted with the Association, but the
proceeds for that loss are payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or
otherwise to the Association, and not to any holder of a Mortgage. The insurance trustee or the
Association must hold any insurance proceeds in trust for the Association, Unit Owners and lien
holders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of Sections 20.9 and 21.4, the
proceeds must be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged property, and the
Association, Unit Owners and lien holders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the
proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or
restored or the Community is terminated. Each Owner appoints the Association, or any insurance
trustee or successor trustee designated by the Association, as attorney-in-fact for the purpose of
purchasing and maintaining such insurance, including the collection and appropriate disposition of
the proceeds thereof, the negotiation of losses and execution of releases of liability, the execution
of all documents and the performance of all other acts necessary to accomplish such purposes.
Each Owner and the Owner’s Mortgagee, if any, are beneficiaries of the policy in accordance with
percentages established by the Common Ownership Interest of Owner’s Unit. Certificates of
insurance shall be issued to each Owner and Mortgagee upon request.
Section 20.7 Additional Insurance. The Association may maintain such other insurance
as the Board deems advisable; provided that notwithstanding any other provisions herein, the
Association shall continuously maintain in effect such casualty, flood, loss of maintenance fees and
liability insurance and a fidelity bond meeting the insurance and fidelity bond requirements for
similar projects established by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD or VA, or other governmental
agencies involved in the secondary mortgage market, so long as any such agency is a Mortgagee
or an Owner of a Unit within the Community or an insurer of a Mortgage encumbering a Unit,
except to the extent such coverage is not reasonably available or has been waived in a Record by
such agency.
Section 20.8 Owners’ Individual Insurance. Each Unit Owner shall maintain special
cause-of-loss coverage in an amount equal to 100% of the replacement cost of its Home and
improvements thereon (exclusive of such items as land, foundations, excavations, and other items
normally excluded from property policies). Each Unit Owner and Tenant shall maintain a liability
policy insuring against liability for property damage or bodily injury caused by the Unit Owner
or Tenant or those for whom each is legally responsible, and cover any obligation to pay or
reimburse the Association for any deductible under the Association’s property insurance or for any
portion of loss caused by the insured and not covered by the Association’s property insurance.
The liability policy shall have a limit of liability of at least $500,000. Owners must obtain the
required insurance from insurance carriers authorized to do business in the State of Washington.
All policies must provide that coverage may not be canceled without 30 day’s written notice to the
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -43-
Association. The Board may adopt Rules that establish greater or more specific requirements for
such policies, including minimum amounts and types of coverage.
Section 20.9 Use of Insurance Proceeds. Any portion of the Community, for which
insurance is required under Section 20.2 which is damaged or destroyed must be repaired or
replaced promptly by the Association pursuant to Article 21.
Section 20.10 Certificate. An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this
Article 20 shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the Association and, upon written
request, to any Unit Owner or Mortgagee. The insurer issuing the policy may not modify the
amount or the extent of the coverage of the policy or cancel or refuse to renew the policy unless
the insurer has complied with all applicable provisions of Chapter 48.18 RCW pertaining to the
cancellation or non-renewal of contracts of insurance.
Section 20.11 Notification of Sale of Unit. Promptly upon Conveyance of a Unit, the new
Unit Owner shall notify the Association of the date of the Conveyance and the Unit Owner’s name
and address. The Association shall notify each insurance company that has issued an insurance
policy to the Association for the benefit of the Owners of the name and address of the new Owner
and request that the new Owner be made a named insured under such policy.
ARTICLE 21 DAMAGE AND REPAIR OF DAMAGE TO PROPERTY
Section 21.1 Definitions: Damage, Substantial Damage, Repair, Emergency Work. As
used in this Article 21:
21.1.1 “Damage” shall mean all kinds of damage, whether of slight
degree or total destruction, caused by casualty or other occurrence, but shall not include
construction defects, deterioration or wear and tear.
21.1.2 “Substantial Damage” shall mean that in the judgment of a
majority of the Board the estimated Assessment determined under Section 21.2.4 for any
one Unit exceeds 3% of the full, fair market value of the Unit before the Damage occurred,
as determined by the then current assessed value for the purpose of real estate taxation.
21.1.3 “Repair” shall mean restoring the damaged improvements to
substantially the condition they were in before they were damaged, with the Unit and the
Common Elements having substantially the same boundaries as before. “Repair” does
include restoration of improvements or betterments installed after Conveyance by the
Declarant if those improvements or betterments are not insured because the Owner failed
to notify the Board of their installation. Modifications to conform to applicable
governmental Rules or available means of construction may be made.
21.1.4 “Emergency Work” shall mean work that the Board deems
reasonably necessary to avoid further Damage or substantial diminution in value to the
improvements and to protect the Owners from liability from the condition of the site.
Section 21.2 Initial Board Determination. In the event of Damage to any portion of the
Community that the Association is required to insure by this Declaration, the Board shall promptly
take the following actions. In doing so, the Board shall obtain such advice from professionals (such
as engineers, architects, contractors, insurance consultants, lenders and attorneys) as the Board
deems advisable and shall consider the information then known to the Board.
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -44-
21.2.1 Determine the nature and extent of the Damage to the insured
property and loss to the Association, together with an inventory of the improvements and
property directly affected thereby.
21.2.2 Obtain as reliable an estimate as possible of the cost and time
to Repair the Damage, which estimate shall, if reasonably practicable, be based upon two
or more firm bids obtained from responsible contractors.
21.2.3 Determine the insurance proceeds and reserves, if any, that will
likely be available to pay for the Damage and file a proof of loss statement with the
insurance company if the loss is covered by insurance.
21.2.4 Determine (i) the amount, if any, by which the estimated cost of
Repair is likely to exceed the expected insurance proceeds, the reserves available to
Repair the Damage, other available funds of the Association, and the deductibles owed by
Owners; and (ii) the likely amount of the Assessments that would have to be made against
each Unit if the excess cost were to be paid as a Common Expense.
Section 21.3 Notice of Damage. The Board shall provide each Owner with a written
notice summarizing the initial Board determinations made under Section 21.2, explaining any
further information needed by the Board to make a final decision on the cost and schedule for
Repairs. If the Board determines that the Damage is Substantial Damage then the notice shall also
explain any further information needed by the Board to allow the Owners to make an informed
decision about Repairs to the Community, and shall call a special meeting to consider whether to
Repair the Damage. If the Damage affects a material portion of the Community, the Board shall
also send the notice to each first Mortgagee. If the Board fails to call a meeting within 30 days of
the Damage, any Owner or Mortgagee may call such a meeting. The Board may, but is not
required to, call such a meeting in other circumstances.
Section 21.4 Execution of Repairs.
21.4.1 The Association shall promptly Repair any damaged portion of
the Community that the Association is responsible to insure and to maintain or repair
unless:
21.4.1.1 The Community is terminated by vote at a special
meeting called in accordance with Section 21.3 and taken in accordance with the
termination provisions in Article 25 of the Declaration and, as applicable, the CIC Act;
21.4.1.2 Repair would be illegal under any state or local health
or safety statute or ordinance; or
21.4.1.3 Owners holding at least 80% of the votes in the
Association, including every Owner of a Unit or Limited Common Element which will not be
rebuilt, and the Declarant if the Declarant has the right to create Units in the Community,
vote not to Repair the Damage.
21.4.2 The Board shall have the authority to employ architects and
engineers, advertise for bids, let contracts to contractors and others and take such other
action as is reasonably necessary to make the Repairs. Contracts for the Repair work
shall be awarded when the Board, by means of insurance proceeds and sufficient
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -45-
Assessments, has provided for paying the cost. The Board may authorize the insurance
carrier to make the Repairs if the Board is satisfied that the work will be done satisfactorily,
and if such authorization does not contravene any insurance trust agreement or
requirement of law.
21.4.3 The Board may enter into a written agreement with a reputable
financial institution or trust or escrow company that the institution or company shall act as
an insurance trustee to adjust and settle any claim for casualty loss in excess of $50,000,
or for the institution or company to collect the insurance proceeds and carry out the
provisions of this Article 21.
The Board may expend so much of the insurance proceeds and Association funds as the
Board deems reasonably necessary for Emergency Work (which Emergency Work may include but
is not necessarily limited to removal of the damaged improvements and clearing, filling, and
grading the land), and the remaining funds, if any, and the property shall thereafter be held and
distributed as provided in Section 21.5. The cost of Repair or replacement in excess of insurance
proceeds, reserves, and deductibles paid by Owners, is a Common Expense.
Section 21.5 Effect of Decision Not to Repair. If all of the damaged or destroyed
portions of the insured property are not repaired or replaced:
21.5.1 The insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged Common
Elements shall be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the
remainder of the Community;
21.5.2 The insurance proceeds attributable to Units and Limited Common
Elements that are not repaired or replaced shall be distributed to the Owners of those Units
and the Owners of the Units to which those Limited Common Elements were allocated or to
lien holders, as their interests may appear; and
21.5.3 The remainder of the proceeds shall be distributed to all the Unit
Owners or lien holders, as their interests may appear, in proportion to their Common
Ownership Interests.
If the Unit Owners vote not to rebuild any Unit, that Unit’s Allocated Interests are automatically
reallocated upon the vote as if the Unit had been condemned under Article 22, and the Association
promptly shall prepare, execute, and record an amendment to this Declaration reflecting the
reallocations. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 21.5, Article 25 governs the
distribution of insurance proceeds if the Community is terminated.
ARTICLE 22 CONDEMNATION
Section 22.1 Power of Attorney. The Association shall represent the Unit Owners in
any legal proceedings related to the condemnation of all or part of the Common Elements, and
shall have the sole authority to control, negotiate and settle such matters on behalf of the Unit
Owners. Each Owner appoints the Association as attorney-in-fact for the purpose of representing
the Owners in any proceedings, negotiations, settlements or agreements regarding a
condemnation of any part of the Common Elements. Any proceeds from a condemnation shall be
paid to the Association for the benefit of affected Units and their Mortgagees, as set forth herein.
Should the Association not act, based on their right to act pursuant to this Section 22.1, the
affected Owners may individually or jointly act on their own behalf.
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -46-
Section 22.2 Consequences of Condemnation; Notices. If any Unit or portion thereof or
the Common Elements or Limited Common Elements or any portion thereof is made the subject
matter of any condemnation or eminent domain proceeding or is otherwise sought to be acquired
by a condemning authority, the Association shall promptly give notice of the proceeding or
proposed acquisition to each Owner and first Mortgagee and to the Declarant unless each and
every Development Right and Special Declarant Right has expired.
Section 22.3 Condemnation of a Unit. If a Unit is acquired by condemnation, or if part
of a Unit is acquired by condemnation leaving the Unit Owner with a remnant of a Unit that may not
practically or lawfully be used for any purpose permitted by this Declaration, the award must
compensate the Owner for the Owner’s Unit and its Allocated Interests, whether or not any
Common Elements are acquired. The award shall be distributed to the Owner or lien holder of the
Unit, as their interests may appear. Upon acquisition, unless the decree otherwise provides, that
Unit’s Allocated Interests are automatically reallocated to the remaining Units in proportion to the
respective Allocated Interests of those Units before the taking, and the Association shall promptly
prepare, execute, and record an amendment to this Declaration reflecting the reallocations. Any
remnant of a Unit remaining after part of a Unit is taken under this Section 22.3 is thereafter a
Common Element.
Section 22.4 Condemnation of Part of a Unit. Except as provided in Section 22.3, if part
of a Unit is acquired by condemnation, the award must compensate the Unit Owner for the
reduction in value of the Unit and its Common Ownership Interest, whether or not any Common
Elements are acquired. The award shall be distributed to the Owner or lien holders of the Unit, as
their interests may appear. Upon acquisition, unless the decree otherwise provides: (a) that Unit’s
Common Ownership Interest and Common Expense Liability are reduced in proportion to the
reduction in the size of the Unit; and (b) the portion of the Allocated Interests divested from the
partially acquired Unit is automatically reallocated to that Unit and the remaining Units in proportion
to the respective Allocated Interests of those Units before the taking, with the partially acquired Unit
participating in the reallocation on the basis of its reduced Allocated Interests.
Section 22.5 Condemnation of Common Element or Limited Common Element. If part
of the Common Elements is acquired by condemnation, any portion of the award attributable to the
acquisition of a Limited Common Element must be equally divided among the Owners of the Unit to
which that Limited Common Element was allocated at the time of the acquisition, or to lien holders,
as their interests may appear, and the portion of the award attributable to the other Common
Elements shall be distributed to the Association. If the Board determines that a particular Owner’s
interest in the Common Elements will be diminished with respect to other Owners by the acquisition
of a Common Element, the Declaration may be amended to adjust that Owner’s Common Expense
Liability allocation, or to remove the allocation of a Limited Common Element to that Owner’s Unit,
as the case may be.
Section 22.6 Reconstruction and Repair. Any reconstruction and repair necessitated by
condemnation shall be governed by the procedures specified in Article 21.
Section 22.7 Taking of Special Declarant Rights. The Association will have no power to
represent the Declarant in any condemnation or eminent domain proceedings relating to any
Development Rights or Special Declarant Rights. The Declarant, and not the Association, will be
entitled to receive all awards attributable to any Development Rights or Special Declarant Rights.
CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -47-
ARTICLE 23 PROCEDURES FOR SUBDIVIDING OR COMBINING UNITS

greater number of Units, and two or more Units may not be combined into a lesser number of
Units. This Section 23.1 does not apply to the exercise of Development Rights.

Community or the Association, including, without limitation, any such claim of breach of contract,
negligence, breach of any duty under the Washington Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act or
breach of any alleged duty of good faith and fair dealing (collectively, “Claims”), shall be resolved
exclusively by binding, non-appeable, arbitration as set forth herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the following matters shall not be Claims subject to mandatory mediation or arbitration under this
Article 28: (i) any action or remedy initiated by or against any Mortgagee, (ii) judicial Foreclosure

actions to collect or enforce any order, decision or award rendered by arbitration.
Section 28.2 Initiation of Arbitration; Mediation. If any party to a Claim determines that
the Claim cannot be resolved without intervention, then that party shall give notice in a Tangle
Medium to all other parties to the Claim demanding that the Claim be submitted to mediation and
arbitration pursuant to this Article 28. The parties shall attempt to resolve any Claims in good faith

difficulty. An attorneys’ fee award must be reasonable under the Washington Rules of Professional
Conduct. For purposes of this section, a party is a prevailing party if it recovers the majority of the
relief it has claimed, or if it prevents another party from recovering the majority of the relief it has
claimed, including the enforcement of this Article 28. It may be appropriate in some cases to

RCW) now in effect and as the same may from time to time be amended, to the exclusion of any
inconsistent state or local law, ordinance or judicial rule. To the extent that any state or local law,

service under which the arbitration proceeding shall be conducted, the rules of the arbitration
service shall govern the conduct of the arbitration.

arbitration after the date such claim could be asserted in a judicial proceeding under applicable
statutes of limitation and repose.
Section 28.11 Enforceability. This Article 28 shall inure to the benefit of, and be

CONDOMINIUM DECLARATION – THE TIMBERS PAGE -52-
this arbitration agreement or any matter arbitrable hereunder, or the filing of a lis pendens, shall not
be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate or to enforce this arbitration agreement, and,
notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, shall not be asserted or accepted as a reason
to delay or refuse to participate in arbitration, or to refuse to enforce this arbitration agreement.
Section 28.12 Severability. If any provision of this Article 28 shall be determined by the
arbitrator or by any court to be unenforceable or to have been waived, the remaining provisions

COST SHARING FOR TRACT 999 DETENTION SYSTEM
The maintenance costs for the Tract 999 detention system shall be shared between the
Association and the City. The Association’s share shall equal 60% of the total maintenance costs.
The City’s share shall equal 40% of the total maintenance costs.
The 60/40 allocation was derived through determining the impervious surfaces of the private
improvements (roof, driveway, patio), and the public improvements (pavement and sidewalks)
tributary to the detention system. The “Basin A/B Bypass to Wetland Area” (noted in the City’s
approved Drainage Report) was considered in the calculation, as it was considered for flow control
modeling purposes though it was not actually tributary to the detention facility.
The City has determined that the initial maintenance cost will equal $6,000 per year. The City
reserves the right to increase the cost annually by 2%, which is equal to the average cost of living
increase. The City shall bill the Association on a periodic basis.

11241 Slater Ave. Suite #200.
Kirkland, WA 98033
Alan Paszek, Secretary/Treasurer
11241 Slater Ave. Suite #200.
Kirkland, WA 98033
ARTICLE 10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
A director or officer of the corporation shall have the immunities from liability as granted under RCW
24.06.035, as it may be amended. Any amendment to or repeal of this Article 10 shall not adversely affect
any right of a director or officer of the corporation hereunder with respect to any acts or omissions of such
director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
ARTICLE 11. INDEMNIFICATION
Except as otherwise set forth in this Article 11, the corporation shall indemnify each person made party to
a threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative, formal or informal (“Proceeding”), because the person is or was a director or officer of the
corporation, against all expenses and liabilities, including attorneys’ fees, incurred in the Proceeding or
any settlement thereof without the requirement of any further approval or finding by the members, the
directors or independent legal counsel.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the corporation shall not indemnify a director or officer under this Article 11
for: (i) acts or omissions of the director finally adjudged to be intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law, (ii) conduct of the person adjudged to be in violation of section 23B.08.310 of the
Washington Business Corporation Act, or (iii) any transaction with respect to which it was finally adjudged
that such person personally received a benefit in money, property, or services to which the person was
not legally entitled.
The corporation shall advance the reasonable expenses incurred by a person who is a party to a
Proceeding if the person furnishes the corporation with a written affirmation of his or her good-faith belief
that he or she met the standard of conduct set forth in this Article 11, and with a written undertaking,
executed personally or on his or her behalf, to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that he or
she did not meet the standard of conduct. The written undertaking must be an unlimited general
obligation of the person and need not be secured, but shall be accepted without reference to the person’s
financial ability to make payment.
If a claim under this Article 11 is not paid in full by the corporation within sixty (60) days after a written
claim has been received by the corporation, or if a claim for expenses incurred in defending a Proceeding
in advance of its final disposition is not paid within twenty (20) days after a written claim has been
ARTICLES –THE TIMBERS CONDOMINIUM HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION
 PAGE -3-
received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to
recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, to the extent successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall
also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. The claimant shall be presumed to be
entitled to indemnification hereunder upon submission of a written claim (and, in an action brought to
enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition,
where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation), and thereafter the corporation
shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption that the claimant is so entitled. It shall be a
defense to any such action (other than an action with respect to expenses) that the claimant has not met
the standard of conduct that makes it permissible hereunder for the corporation to indemnify the claimant
for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the
failure of the corporation (including its directors, independent legal counsel, or members) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of or reimbursement or
advancement of expenses to the claimant is proper under the circumstances because he or she has met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth herein nor an actual determination by the corporation
(including its directors, independent legal counsel, or members) that the claimant is not entitled to
indemnification or to the reimbursement or advancement of expenses shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant is not so entitled.
The rights conferred in this Article 11 shall not be exclusive of any other right that any person may have
or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws, agreement,
vote of members or disinterested directors, or otherwise.
Any rights provided under this Article 11 shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.
The rights of a director or officer arising hereunder shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment
to or repeal of this Article 11 after the occurrence of the act or omission that is the subject of the
Proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article 11 is sought. The
rights conferred by this Article 11 shall be deemed to be contract rights between the corporation and each
person who is or was a director or officer. The corporation expressly intends each such person to rely on
the rights conferred hereby in performing his or her respective duties on behalf of the corporation.
ARTICLE 12. DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS
No member has paid any consideration to the corporation for its membership. A dissenting member shall
be limited to a return of one dollar for its membership interest in any circumstance under which it may be
entitled to a return under Section 245 of the Nonprofit Act.
ARTICLE 13. AMENDMENT
These Articles of Incorporation may only be amended as set forth in the Declaration.
ARTICLE 14. INCORPORATOR
The name and address of the incorporator is Chalo Wilson, 11241 Slater Ave NE, Suite 200, Kirkland,
WA 98033.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the incorporator has hereunto set his hand and seal this 30th day of November
2018.

 Chalo Wilson, Incorporator
